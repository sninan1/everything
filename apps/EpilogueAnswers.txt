Hi! I uploaded the necessary url folders that should have my functioning code in there. If not, let me know! 
To answer the questions in the epoligue: 
The three most important things I would change and also what I implemented: 

1) Refactoring further: My code is kind of confusing because I encountered a few unexpected errors and tried to accomedate accordingly, but
I've never worked with typescript/javascript prior to this, which becomes clear in the organization of my code. I think I would further refactor 
main.ts especially into smaller parts, to make the backend more accessible to work with. 

2) Error handling: The component I added was some error/loading patterns on the front end, but the error methods I implemented definitely could 
have been improved to validate user inputs, and also in the backend by validating if the final HTTP code of the updated URL is correct. 

3) Adding tests would also be a good way to improve the codebase. 

Like I said above, I implemented some error/loading patterns to the app.tsx file to make my code more unique.
